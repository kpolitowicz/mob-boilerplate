# What?

This repo is a boilerplate of easy-to-start-with snippets in different languages. The idea is to have an easy start when trying to solve a problem with a script/class/module, having support for rudimentsary testing, reading inputr file, etc.

# How?

We recommend using mob.sh (https://mob.sh/) tool for ping-pong style of collaboration. One person writes a test, the other implements the logic so that the test passes. And then they switch roles...

# Why?

Good question...
